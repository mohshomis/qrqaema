# Technical Debt & Current Issues

This document outlines the current technical debt and issues that need to be addressed in the Restaurant Order System.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Production Configuration Issues
- `DEBUG=True` in production settings
  - **Risk**: Exposes sensitive debug information to users
  - **Fix**: Set `DEBUG=False` in production and ensure proper error handling
- Exposed `SECRET_KEY` in settings files
  - **Risk**: Compromises Django's security features
  - **Fix**: Move to environment variables
- `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=True`
  - **Risk**: Allows any origin to make requests
  - **Fix**: Configure specific allowed origins

### 2. Database Configuration
- SQLite usage in deployment
  - **Risk**: Not suitable for production, lacks scalability
  - **Fix**: Migrate to PostgreSQL
- Exposed database credentials
  - **Risk**: Unauthorized database access
  - **Fix**: Move credentials to environment variables

### 3. Media Storage
- Exposed media storage credentials
  - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to stored files
  - **Fix**: Move DigitalOcean Spaces credentials to environment variables
- Improper file permissions
  - **Risk**: Potential unauthorized file access
  - **Fix**: Implement proper file access controls

## Testing Issues

### 1. Missing Test Coverage
- No unit tests for backend
  - Models untested
  - Views untested
  - Serializers untested
- No unit tests for frontend
  - Components untested
  - Utilities untested
  - Context providers untested
- No integration tests
  - API endpoints untested
  - Database operations untested
- No end-to-end tests
  - User flows untested
  - Critical paths untested

### 2. Testing Infrastructure Needed
- Test environment configuration
- Test data fixtures
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance testing setup

## Translation Issues

### 1. Missing Translations
- Incomplete translations for:
  - Arabic (ar)
  - Turkish (tr)
  - Dutch (nl)
- Missing translation keys in some components
- Inconsistent translation key naming

### 2. Translation Management
- No systematic way to track missing translations
- No translation validation system
- No automated translation testing
- Incomplete RTL support for Arabic

## Frontend Issues

### 1. Code Quality
- Hardcoded API endpoints
  - **Location**: `src/services/api.js`
  - **Fix**: Move to configuration
- Incomplete error handling
  - Missing error boundaries
  - Inconsistent error messaging
  - No offline handling

### 2. Performance
- Missing API response caching
- No image optimization
- No code splitting
- Large bundle size
- No performance monitoring

### 3. State Management
- Local storage limitations
- Inconsistent state management patterns
- No proper cache invalidation
- Memory leaks in some components

## Backend Issues

### 1. Infrastructure
- Mixed configuration between Heroku and DigitalOcean
  - Inconsistent deployment process
  - Multiple configuration files
- Missing secure headers
  - No HSTS
  - No CSP
  - No X-Frame-Options

### 2. API Design
- Inconsistent error responses
- Missing rate limiting
- No API versioning
- Incomplete API documentation

### 3. Database
- Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
- No database query optimization
- No connection pooling
- No database backup strategy

## DevOps Issues

### 1. Deployment
- Manual deployment process
- No staging environment
- No rollback procedure
- No deployment monitoring

### 2. Monitoring
- No error tracking
- No performance monitoring
- No user analytics
- No server monitoring

## Required Actions

### Immediate (1-2 Weeks)
1. Fix critical security issues
   - Move sensitive data to environment variables
   - Configure proper CORS settings
   - Set up secure headers
2. Set up basic testing infrastructure
   - Configure test environments
   - Write critical path tests
3. Address critical translation issues
   - Complete missing translations
   - Fix RTL issues

### Short-term (1 Month)
1. Improve deployment process
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure staging environment
2. Implement monitoring
   - Set up error tracking
   - Configure performance monitoring
3. Optimize database
   - Add necessary indexes
   - Implement query optimization

### Long-term (3 Months)
1. Complete test coverage
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
2. Implement caching strategy
   - API response caching
   - Static asset caching
3. Optimize frontend performance
   - Code splitting
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Image optimization

## Tracking Progress

Create tickets in the issue tracking system for each item with the following labels:
- `technical-debt`
- `security`
- `testing`
- `performance`
- `translation`
- Priority level (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`)

## Resources Needed

1. Development Resources
   - Additional testing resources
   - DevOps engineer for CI/CD
   - Security audit expertise

2. Tools & Services
   - Error tracking service (e.g., Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Translation management system

3. Documentation
   - Security guidelines
   - Testing standards
   - Deployment procedures
   - Translation workflow

## Next Steps

1. Review this document with the team
2. Prioritize issues based on impact and urgency
3. Create detailed tickets for each issue
4. Assign responsibilities and set deadlines
5. Schedule regular progress reviews
